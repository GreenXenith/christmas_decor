## Stockings
Stockings will automatically fill once Christmas arrives, or at least that's the idea. Extensive testing has supposedly confirmed this.  
Each player is only allowed to place a single stocking at a time. Items can only be taken/added by the owner or players with protection_bypass.  
  
By default stockings will be filled with 20 candycanes, 10 gingerbread men, 1 elf hat, 99 gold ingots, and a set of default mese tools. To use custom items instead, add a `christmas_decor.stocking_stuffers` setting to your configuration file with a comma-separated list of items and optional counts.  
  
Example:  
`christmas_decor.stocking_stuffers = default:diamond 30, default:coal_lump, yourmod:someitem 99`
